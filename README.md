# Second-ML-project

This project explores the use of machine learning models to analyze and predict bike rentals. A variety of models including linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression are employed to determine the relationship between a set of predictive variables and the target variable, which is the number of rented bikes.

The available data is utilized to train the models and evaluate their performance using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, some variables are transformed to be within a certain range using transformation techniques such as StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

After training the models, their performance is evaluated and compared using RMSE to identify the most accurate model in predicting the number of rented bikes. Model comparison is conducted to provide a clear idea of their performance and the most effective model in this context.

The process is well-documented with comprehensive code comments and visual presentation of analysis and prediction results using graphs.
